## Code Description
The project consists of the following files:
    server.js: Sets up the server and defines routes.
    controller.js: Houses controller functions responsible for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    router.js: Manages the definition of routes for processing HTTP requests.
    request.js: Includes functions to test the API endpoints.
## How to use
  1. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone [repository-url], replacing [repository-url] with the actual URL of the repository.
  2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install required dependencies by executing cd [project-name] followed by npm install, replacing [project-name] with your project folder's name.
  3. Set Up MongoDB Atlas: Configure MongoDB Atlas by creating a cluster and connect it to your application; ensure your MongoDB connection string is ready for use.
  4. Run the Server: Start the server by running node server.js to handle requests.
  5. Test the API Endpoints: Evaluate the API's functionality by running the test script with node test.js.
